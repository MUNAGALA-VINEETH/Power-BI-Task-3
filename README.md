Task 3: Real-Time Temperature Monitoring Dashboard
In Task 3, I designed a Power BI dashboard to monitor temperature values over time using timestamped data. I added visuals like area charts to represent temperature trends and cards to highlight total, max, and latest temperature values. This task improved my understanding of real-time data visualization, helping users analyze sensor data quickly and effectively.
